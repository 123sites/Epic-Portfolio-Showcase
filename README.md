## ⭐ Portfolio Showcase ⭐

## Description ✏️

This is a portfolio the shows what I can do with coding.  I gathered evidence over time during the Full-Stack computer coding boot camp I completed.  For this project, I added my own style and added a video I created.  I added a 555-5555 phone number and email for now.
