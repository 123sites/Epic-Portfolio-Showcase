To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits 👈

Over time, I worked hard on all my projects.  If I had trouble, I first tried to solve the problem myself.  I used Google and YouTube to help problem-solve.  Only when I was really stuck, I took the initiative to ask for help from others.
